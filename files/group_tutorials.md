# Bonus: Tutorials (Group Work)

This work is completely optional and will count as a bonus to the whole group.

## Introduction

There are various amazing packages in R which we do not have the time to cover. But, you can contribute to promotion of these packages with a good tutorial! In this project, you are expected to introduce a substantial package and work on a simple but illustrative example. Your work should consist of two parts.

1. A written tutorial (or vignette) from the start to the end on RMarkdown with code, data and explanations.
2. A video tutorial of presentation, live coding and commentary (3-7 minutes).

Your work should be completely reproducible. Your presentation should include the names of the members. Upload your work and videos on your Group Progress Journals.

## Deadlines

Proposal deadline is September 3, 2020. You just need to your instructor on Slack ("Our group X will introduce package Y") and write on your GPJ on approval. Each package can be introduced by only one group. First come, first served.

Final presentation deadline is September 10, 2020.

## Packages

These are R packages which you are expected to create tutorials on. You might suggest different R packages (subject to instructor's approval).
